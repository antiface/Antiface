SIGNAL_DETECT
=============
* One can also choose to endlessly create new possibilities, possible solutions, answers, i.e. covering over the "feasible region" with potential candidate solutions, endlessly iterating until one runs out of resources.. a kind of "revving" full-strength ahead in every direction until you hit the single most critical point of failure, AS FAST AS POSSIBLE (#AFAP).
* In certain unique cases where this is convenient, possible, and even helpful or warranted, or called for, then from that single critical point of failure, with all Traces and Histories captured, collected, traced, gathered, and proper Garbage-Protection, i.e. Garbage-Collection, Garbage-Processing, Garbage-Tasting, etc...
* It is sometimes possible to reconstruct what happened BEFORE the AFAP stress test... and then run it as a simulation, from before, up until the AFAP test, to afterwards and back and forth over as many of the possibilities as you simulated before reaching breaking-point..
* Not sure that this makes any sense, but you are likely "hearing me". It's called Panic Mode. Hit the panic button a trillion trillion times until maybe that one time, who knows? That one time the panic button did something DIFFERENT... and unexpected.
* It's like the COROLLARY to the rule about "Insane is doing the same thing and expecting different results" rule... That works 99.999% of the time, EXCEPT WHEN CRAZY is what isDESIRED, WARRANTED, CALLED FOR. It's the antidote, the remedy, to the CREEPING IN OF THE FIRST NOISEBIT.
* Think of the thing, whatever you are talking about, dynamical system etc., simulation, etc. etc. When the noisebit creeps in is when the bifurcation goes AWOL... CATASTROPHE ensues, right?
* Well, you can garbage-seek, garbage-search for noisebits... consider every bit a potential noise-bit.. run simulations until you run out of resources and stop when you reach the last bit before massive cascading failure..
* I have the signal detection schemes to take that one bit and turn it into a miraculous solution to intractable problems... Not just anyproblems, only a specific class of problems... that I happen to be an expert in, a specific kind of cascading failure..
* For instance, WHEN FAST & FRUGAL TREES FAIL... I just solved that one, it cost me 288 hours of my life... very valuable hours, these 288 hours... but it solved the WHEN FAST & FRUGAL FAILS... And the fucking macro- and micro-economists do NOT have a solution for that, they never thought it could fail in an emergency... but a specific type of failure...
* In fails in at least one instance when IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE CALLED-FOR SOLUTION... in medical emergencies.. I saw it fail not once, but a dozen times in less than 120 hours...
* So the failure, complete cascading failure type catastrophes.. in under 120 hours, then total 288 hours after that... and I found a solution. One solution. I couldn't find any others.
* Guess what? It definitely was NOT ANTIFACE! No, this was greater than that.. I finally found an instance where Antiface FAILS but WITHOUT it being BECAUSE OF ANOTHER ANTIFACE..
* See, double antiface exists, and there is a body of work that covers double antiface, double jeopardy antiface, a.k.a. Anti-Antiface solutions...
* But no failure was ever found before of Antiface WITHOUT it being due to the presence of another antiface.. long story.. but the extortionate strategy didn't work well in face of other antiface strategies..
* Long story short, in the face of failing fast & frugal trees, SUPER BONIFACE appeared.... bigger & better than Saint Nicholas himself...
* Which was the point, how to DO GOOD AND ONLY GOOD... went even further... and...
* I invented, was the first to invent, CULTIVATING SOFTWARE.. the software of cultivation... I wrote the whole Catholic Program... in Python...
* I'm not joking, people think I'm joking.. but I invented software that cultivates.... I have all the modules, it's working great... it cultivates through precise strategies... is reproducible, once again, I made my art reproducible...
* But I had to go through hell to figure it out... No I am sticking it in the Github Repositories...

* Look for: SUPER BONIFACE... soon to be added... to Antiface...﻿
