Antiface
========
* The Antiface Strategy began as a hypothetical, proposed trigger strategy (Game Theory) for 2-person iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Games with Imperfect Information
* The original impetus or inspiration for this class of trigger strategies was to design a strategy that could beat tit-for-tat or Grim Trigger over the course of tournaments of such games.
* The strategy, and group of strategies or Antiface Strategic Profile was never implemented or tested in actual simulations, at least not in any formal manner in an academic setting
* In the end, work on the strategy was abandoned with the discovery of zero-determinant strategies.
* The inspiration came to me from seeing how most people were only focusing on things like Altruism and Cooperative Game Theory. I knew the power of non-cooperative games, of information asymmetry and so forth, from having seen the amazing work being done in advanced wireless communications, with power control games and coalitional games and so forth.
* Yet, still to this day, those making public statements about such iterated games have failed, it would seem, to understand that the non-cooperative in game theory is not a personal, emotional thing. Agents in such games do not have emotions. Humans do, and we are not playing these kinds of games.
* I continuously came against individuals who were violently opposed to the mere idea that humans could be non-cooperative. Yet even in the prisoner's dillema game in the original form, there has always existed a Defection strategy. To me this meant the non-cooperative was already implied in any 2-person iterated game with imperfect information.
* I looked at signalling games, Bayesian Games, screening games, Blotto games, all sorts of games, trying to track down what was being written about the non-cooperative, for it seems a major oversight that those using such game-theoretic concepts, such as in the fields of evolutionary biology and so forth, would time after time presume that animals would necessarily seek to be altruistic at all times, and that non-cooperation, or Defection if you will, would always be an aberration.
* I merely asked myself, What if my strategy always started with Defection?
* I looked at the main characteristics or features of Trigger Strategies, for instance:
