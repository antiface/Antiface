Antiface
========
* The Antiface Strategy began as a hypothetical, proposed trigger strategy (Game Theory) for 2-person iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Games with Imperfect Information
* The original impetus or inspiration for this class of trigger strategies was to design a strategy that could beat tit-for-tat or Grim Trigger over the course of tournaments of such games.
* The strategy, and group of strategies or Antiface Strategic Profile was never implemented or tested in actual simulations, at least not in any formal manner in an academic setting
* In the end, work on the strategy was abandoned with the discovery of zero-determinant strategies.
